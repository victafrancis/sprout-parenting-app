# 🌱 Weekly Developmental Plan

Age: 10 months
Primary Focus Schema: Trajectory (dropping, rolling, watching movement)
Secondary Focus: Enveloping (in/out, covering, uncovering)
Routine Focus: Diapering + Mealtime as learning moments

## 🎯 Weekly Goals (Observable)

**Goal 1 – Gross Motor & Problem Solving**
Crawls to retrieve a rolled or dropped object in 2 different rooms, on at least 3 days this week.

**Goal 2 – Communication & Joint Attention**
Pauses and looks at caregiver before dropping or throwing an object at least 2 times per day.

**Goal 3 – Fine Motor**
Places a large object into a container independently at least 5 times in a session.

### Weekend (Repeat & Extend)

Repeat the activities your child engaged with most. Repetition strengthens learning at this age.

## 👶 Caregiving-as-Learning Scripts

**Diapering**
- "I'm going to pick you up." (pause)
- "Can you give me your leg?" (wait)
- Narrate actions slowly.
- Allow child to participate (holding diaper, dropping it in bin).

**Feeding**
- "You're holding the banana."
- Pause.
- "You took a bite!"
- Wait for eye contact or vocal response.

## 🔎 What to Observe This Week

Log brief notes (1–2 minutes daily):

- Does the child look at you before dropping objects?
- Are crawling distances increasing?
- Is the child experimenting with different dropping heights?
- Does the child attempt to put objects inside containers independently?
- Is there more back-and-forth vocal exchange?

## 🔁 End-of-Week Reflection

Ask:

- Which activities held attention longest?
- Did frustration occur? (If yes → simplify next week.)
- Is dropping behavior shifting toward more intentional interaction?
- Is container play increasing?

## ➡️ How Next Week Might Progress

**If trajectory play is consistent and joyful:**
- Add "throw toward target" (soft ball into basket from short distance)
- Add new rolling surfaces (grass, carpet, tile)

**If container play increases:**
- Introduce nesting cups
- Encourage putting objects through large opening in box lid

**If frustration appears:**
- Make containers bigger
- Reduce distance for crawling retrieval

## 🛟 Safety Reminders

- No small objects (choking risk).
- Water play only within arm's reach.
- Avoid strings or long cords.
- Supervise all climbing.
