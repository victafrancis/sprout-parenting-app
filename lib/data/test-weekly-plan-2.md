# 🌱 Weekly Developmental Plan: Week 2

**Context:** Progression from Week 1 (Met baseline trajectory goals)
**Age:** 10 months + 1 week
**Primary Schema Shift:** Trajectory (adding accuracy/targets)
**New Secondary Schema:** Transporting (moving things from A to B)
**Routine Focus:** Dressing + Bath (Autonomy & Volume)

## 📊 Logic for this Week's Updates
*Based on the "Decision Rules" for home planning:*
* **Progress (Trajectory):** The child mastered simple "dropping." We now add a specific *target* (the "Post-it" game) to increase fine motor challenge.
* **Pivot (New Focus):** The child showed interest in moving the laundry basket last week. We are pivoting to **Transporting** (pushing/carrying) as a secondary focus.

## 🎯 Weekly Goals (Observable)

**Goal 1 – Gross Motor (Transporting)**
Pushes a weighted object (box or basket) across the floor for 3–5 feet without tipping over (cruising/crawling mix).

**Goal 2 – Fine Motor (Trajectory Accuracy)**
Successfully drops an object *through* a specific opening (cardboard tube or wide box slot) rather than just "letting go."

**Goal 3 – Routine Autonomy (Dressing)**
Pushes arm or leg through a sleeve/pant leg when the hole is held open by the caregiver.

## 🧺 Weekly Activity Menu

*Pick 3–5 per day. Focus on "heavy work" (pushing) and "precision" (aiming).*

### Monday
**1. The "Delivery Truck" (Transporting)**
* **Materials:** Diaper box (weighted with books/toys so it doesn't tip).
* **Action:** Encourage child to push the box across the carpet.
* **Goal:** Gross motor exertion and moving objects.

**2. Cardboard Tube Drop (Trajectory + Precision)**
* **Setup:** Tape an empty paper towel roll to the wall (low).
* **Action:** Child drops a small ball *into* the tube and watches it shoot out the bottom.
* **Why:** Requires more aim than a bucket drop.

**3. "Where's Your Arm?" (Routine Focus)**
* **During Dressing:** Hold the sleeve open.
* **Prompt:** "Push your hand... push!" (Wait for effort).

### Tuesday
**1. Kitchen Tupperware Transfer**
* **Materials:** Two large bowls, one wooden spoon, safe large pasta/blocks.
* **Action:** Move items from Bowl A to Bowl B using hands or the spoon.

**2. Tunnel Crawl (Orientation + Trajectory)**
* **Setup:** Pop-up tunnel or blanket over two chairs.
* **Action:** Roll a ball *through* the tunnel; child crawls inside to retrieve it.

**3. Bath Time: Volume Pouring**
* **Materials:** Two cups of different sizes.
* **Action:** Pour water from the big cup into the little cup (and let it overflow).
* **Script:** "Full... pouring... overflow/splash!"

### Wednesday
**1. "Mailbox" Game (Enveloping + Trajectory)**
* **Setup:** Shoe box with a wide slit cut in the lid.
* **Action:** "Post" jar lids or stiff cards into the slot.
* **Challenge:** Requires orienting the object correctly to fit.

**2. The Loaded Wagon (Transporting)**
* **Action:** Put a favorite stuffed animal in a basket.
* **Prompt:** "Take Bear to the kitchen." Help child slide/push the basket.

**3. Sensory "Sticky" Wall**
* **Materials:** Contact paper (sticky side out) taped to wall/window.
* **Action:** Stick light toys/paper on, pull them off.
* **Schema:** Connecting/Disconnecting.

### Thursday
**1. Ramp 2.0 (Velocity)**
* **Setup:** Use a harder surface (book or baking sheet) for the ramp instead of a towel.
* **Observation:** The ball moves faster. Does the child track it better?

**2. "Help Me Clean" (Transporting)**
* **Action:** Hand child a toy.
* **Prompt:** "Put it in the bin." (Walk/crawl together to the bin).
* **Repeat:** Do this for 3–4 items.

**3. Mirror Body Parts**
* **Action:** Sit in front of mirror.
* **Prompt:** Touch child's nose. "Nose." Wait for them to reach for the mirror or their own nose.

### Friday
**1. Obstacle Carry (Gross Motor)**
* **Setup:** Place a cushion on the floor.
* **Challenge:** Encourage child to carry a soft block *while* crawling/climbing over the cushion.

**2. Tube Drop "Race"**
* **Variation:** Drop two items in the tube quickly.
* **Observation:** Does the child look at the bottom *before* the item falls out? (Prediction).

**3. Gentle Spin (Rotation Intro)**
* **Action:** Spin a mixing bowl on the floor.
* **Goal:** Watch the rotation (preparing for next schema).

### Weekend
**Follow the Lead:**
* If they loved the **Tube Drop**, add a second tube.
* If they loved **Pushing the Box**, add more weight to it.

## 👶 Caregiving-as-Learning Scripts

**Dressing (Montessori-aligned)**
* *Old way:* Adult does all the work.
* *New way:* "I'm holding the sleeve. You push." (Count to 5 mentally).
* *Success:* "You pushed your arm through!"

**Bathing (Science/Physics)**
* "The cup is empty." (Show bottom).
* "Now it is full." (Heavy).
* "Pour it out!"

## 🔎 What to Observe This Week
* **Precision:** Is the child getting frustrated with the "Mailbox" slot? (If yes -> make slot bigger).
* **Transporting:** Does the child prefer *carrying* (in hand) or *pushing* (on floor)?
* **Safety:** Ensure the "Push Box" is heavy enough not to flip if they pull up on it.

## 🔁 End-of-Week Decision Rules
* **Continue:** If "Mailbox" is still hard but fun, keep doing it.
* **Progress:** If they are walking well while pushing the box, try a lighter push-toy that moves faster.
* **Pivot:** If they start spinning wheels or bowls constantly, shift focus to **Rotation** next week.
