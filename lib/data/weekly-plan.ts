const weeklyPlanContent = "# 🌱 Weekly Developmental Plan\n\nAge: 10 months\nPrimary Focus Schema: Trajectory (dropping, rolling, watching movement)\nSecondary Focus: Enveloping (in/out, covering, uncovering)\nRoutine Focus: Diapering + Mealtime as learning moments\n\n## 🎯 Weekly Goals (Observable)\n\n**Goal 1 – Gross Motor & Problem Solving**\nCrawls to retrieve a rolled or dropped object in 2 different rooms, on at least 3 days this week.\n\n**Goal 2 – Communication & Joint Attention**\nPauses and looks at caregiver before dropping or throwing an object at least 2 times per day.\n\n**Goal 3 – Fine Motor**\nPlaces a large object into a container independently at least 5 times in a session.\n\n## 🧺 Weekly Activity Menu\n\nPick 3–5 per day, repeat favorites. These are short (2–8 minutes), flexible options — not a rigid schedule.\n\n### Monday\n\n**1. Drop & Watch (Trajectory)**\n- Materials: Laundry basket + 3 soft balls\n- Adult prompt: \"Ready… drop!\" (pause, wait for eye contact)\n- Extend: Move basket farther away\n\n**2. Crawl Chase (Gross Motor)**\n- Roll ball slowly across room\n- Encourage retrieval\n- Celebrate effort, not speed\n\n**3. Peek-a-Boo Cloth (Enveloping)**\n- Hide toy under cloth\n- Wait for child to pull it away\n\n### Tuesday\n\n**1. Towel Ramp Roll**\n- Fold towel to create slight ramp\n- Roll ball down\n- Encourage crawling after it\n\n**2. Container Fill & Dump**\n- Large blocks + big bowl\n- Practice \"in… out!\"\n\n**3. Mealtime Language Pause**\n- When child drops spoon, say: \"You dropped it.\" (pause)\n- Wait for response before picking up\n\n### Wednesday\n\n**1. Water Play (Supervised)**\n- Small bowl + cup\n- Drip water from cloth into bowl\n- Label: \"Drip… splash.\"\n\n**2. Cushion Crawl Path**\n- Couch cushions on floor\n- Encourage crawling over soft obstacles\n\n**3. Diapering Participation (Routine Focus)**\n\nScript:\n- \"I'm going to change your diaper.\" (pause)\n- \"Can you lift your bottom?\" (wait)\n- Allow child to drop old diaper into bin.\n\n### Thursday\n\n**1. Rolling Under Table (Orientation + Trajectory)**\n- Roll ball so it goes partially under chair\n- Encourage problem-solving retrieval\n\n**2. Sock Transfer (Transporting Bridge Skill)**\n- Move socks from laundry basket to box\n\n**3. Mirror Babble Game**\n- Copy child's sounds\n- Pause and wait\n- Encourage back-and-forth exchange\n\n### Friday\n\n**1. Drop into Different Containers**\n- Basket vs. bowl vs. box\n- Observe if child adjusts hand movement\n\n**2. Hide & Find Toy**\n- Partially cover toy with cloth\n- Wait before assisting\n\n**3. Mealtime Choice**\n- Offer: \"Water or milk?\"\n- Pause for gesture or sound.\n\n### Weekend (Repeat & Extend)\n\nRepeat the activities your child engaged with most. Repetition strengthens learning at this age.\n\n## 👶 Caregiving-as-Learning Scripts\n\n**Diapering**\n- \"I'm going to pick you up.\" (pause)\n- \"Can you give me your leg?\" (wait)\n- Narrate actions slowly.\n- Allow child to participate (holding diaper, dropping it in bin).\n\n**Feeding**\n- \"You're holding the banana.\"\n- Pause.\n- \"You took a bite!\"\n- Wait for eye contact or vocal response.\n\n## 🔎 What to Observe This Week\n\nLog brief notes (1–2 minutes daily):\n\n- Does the child look at you before dropping objects?\n- Are crawling distances increasing?\n- Is the child experimenting with different dropping heights?\n- Does the child attempt to put objects inside containers independently?\n- Is there more back-and-forth vocal exchange?\n\n## 🔁 End-of-Week Reflection\n\nAsk:\n\n- Which activities held attention longest?\n- Did frustration occur? (If yes → simplify next week.)\n- Is dropping behavior shifting toward more intentional interaction?\n- Is container play increasing?\n\n## ➡️ How Next Week Might Progress\n\n**If trajectory play is consistent and joyful:**\n- Add \"throw toward target\" (soft ball into basket from short distance)\n- Add new rolling surfaces (grass, carpet, tile)\n\n**If container play increases:**\n- Introduce nesting cups\n- Encourage putting objects through large opening in box lid\n\n**If frustration appears:**\n- Make containers bigger\n- Reduce distance for crawling retrieval\n\n## 🛟 Safety Reminders\n\n- No small objects (choking risk).\n- Water play only within arm's reach.\n- Avoid strings or long cords.\n- Supervise all climbing.\n"
