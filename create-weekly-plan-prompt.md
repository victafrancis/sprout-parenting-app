Create a Weekly Developmental Plan using the exact structured format below.

Child Information (completed based on information about the child):
- Age (in months):
- Mobility level (e.g., crawling, cruising, walking):
- Communication level (e.g., babbling, single words, pointing):
- Current interests / repeated behaviors observed:
- Any sensitivities or frustrations:
- Environment notes (home space, siblings, daycare, etc.):
- Parent priority focus (optional):

Plan Requirements:
- Use the exact same headers and structure as the saved Weekly Developmental Plan template.
- Choose a Primary Schema based on the behaviors described.
- Optionally include a Secondary Schema if relevant.
- Write 2–3 observable, measurable goals.
- Provide daily activity suggestions Monday–Friday (2–3 per day).
- Include a Weekend repeat & extend section.
- Include Caregiving-as-Learning scripts (at least 2 routines).
- Include a “What to Observe” section.
- Include End-of-Week Reflection prompts.
- Include Next Week Progression guidance.
- Keep activities short (2–10 minutes), flexible, and repetition-friendly.
- Ensure all activities are developmentally appropriate and safe for the child’s age.
- Emphasize autonomy, responsive interaction, and repetition.
- Avoid rigid scheduling — use menu-style options.

Output Format:
Use the following exact headers:

# 🔎 What to Observe This Week

Log brief notes (1–2 minutes daily):

- [Communication attempt]
- [Participation in routines]

---

# 🔁 End-of-Week Reflection

Ask:

- Which activities held attention longest?
- Did frustration occur? (If yes → simplify next week.)
- Is repetition increasing skill?
- Is engagement becoming more intentional?
- Any new dominant schema emerging?

---

# ➡️ How Next Week Might Progress

If primary schema is strong:
- [Add complexity idea]
- [Add variation idea]

If secondary skills are emerging:
- [Extension idea]
- [Combine two schemas]

If frustration appears:

- Increase object size  
- Reduce distance  
- Shorten duration

# 🛟 Safety Reminders
