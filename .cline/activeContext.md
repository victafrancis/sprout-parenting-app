# Active Context

## Current Task
Idle / waiting for next feature.

## Current Status
- No active implementation in progress.

## Watch Items
- Dependency/security monitor: `minimatch` advisory (`GHSA-3ppc-4f35-3m26`) is transitive via `@ducanh2912/next-pwa -> workbox-build -> glob`, with no upstream fix currently available. Re-check when `next-pwa`/`workbox` releases update.
- Maintenance note: run `npm outdated` / `npm audit` only during periodic maintenance windows, not as a blocker for feature delivery.

## Open Decisions / Blockers
- None.

## Immediate Next Steps
1. Await next product/UI priority.
