# Active Context

## Current Task
No active implementation task in progress.

## Current Status
- Last completed work: fixed daily-log timestamp labeling so historical entries no longer display stale `Just now`.
- Daily log list now derives `timeLabel` from `createdAt` (or `SK` fallback) at read time.
- TypeScript validation passed (`TS_EXIT_CODE:0`).

## Open Decisions / Blockers
- None.

## Immediate Next Steps
1. Wait for next requested task.
